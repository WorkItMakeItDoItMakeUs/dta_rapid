  <h1>DTA Rapid Prototyping Theme</h1>
  <p>This Jekyll theme uses CSS and javascript written by the Digital Transformation Agency
  to make it easy to quickly prototype online user journeys with a government-y look and feel.</p>
  <p>Content can be written as HTML or markdown (see: <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">daring fireball - markdown</a>). For fancier components and reuse we use Jekyll includes (see: <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/includes/">the Jekyll documentation on includes</a>).</p>
  <h2>Examples</h2>
  {% include callout.html text="This is an example of an include" %}
